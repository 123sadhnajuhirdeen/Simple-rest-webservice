# Simple-rest-webservice

This is simple rest web service created by Java and deployed on apache tomcat server.

I have defined two web services (book,book2)
actually web services are the services which exposed to internet for programatic access.

You can run this project on tomcat and in the browser you can get the response by like this,

1.http://localhost:8080/WSdemo/book
  result is,
  
  <?xml version="1.0"?>
<hello>Hello XML</hello>


2.http://localhost:8080/WSdemo/book2/SADHNA
  result is, 
  <?xml version="1.0"?>
<hello>Hello SADHNA</hello>
